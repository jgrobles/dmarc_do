# dmarc_do
A basic script to extract information from the DMARC Report XML.

The idea behind the script, is to get all the useful information that comes in the DMARC Report XML file that you received from others domains. With this information in hand, you can see how good (or bad) is your domain doing in the war against spam.

Keep in mind that I'm not a developer, just a sysadmin guy who is sharing a personal tool in order to give something back to society.

Any suggestion or collaboration is very welcome.

Usage: ./dmarc_do.sh + XML file
