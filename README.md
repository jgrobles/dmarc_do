# dmarc_do
A basic script to extract information from the DMARC Report XML

The idea begin the script, is to get all the information about the DMARC Report XML that you received from others domains.
With this information extracted, you can see how good (or bad) is your domain doing in the war against spam and others e-mailing threats.

Keep in mind that I'm not a developer, just a sysadmin guy who is sharing a personal tool in order to give something back to society.

Any sugestion or collaboration is very welcome.
